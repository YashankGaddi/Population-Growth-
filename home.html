            <h2>INFO REGARDING POPULATION GROWTH</h2>
            <p><b>Population growth is one of the most important topics we cover at Our World in Data.
                For most of human history, the global population was a tiny fraction of what it is today. Over the last few centuries, the human population has gone through an extraordinary change. In 1800, there were one billion people. Today there are more than 8 billion of us.
                But after a period of very fast population growth, demographers expect the world population to peak by the end of this century.
                On this page, you will find all of our data, charts, and writing on changes in population growth. This includes how populations are distributed worldwide, how this has changed, and what demographers expect for the future.</b></p>
                <br>
                <p><b>The speed of global population growth over the last few centuries has been staggering. For most of human history, the world population was well under one million.1
                    As recently as 12,000 years ago, there were only 4 million people worldwide.
                    The chart shows the rapid increase in the global population since 1700. 
                    The one-billion mark wasn’t broken until the early 1800s. It was only a century ago that there were 2 billion people.
                    Since then, the global population has quadrupled to eight billion.
                    Around 108 billion people have ever lived on our planet. This means that today’s population size makes up 6.5% of the total number of people ever born.2
                    This increase has been the result of advances in living conditions and health that reduced death rates – especially in children – and increases in life expectancy.</b></p>
